    "# Installing git and some useful shell commands\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this topic, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- install git on your local machine\n",
    "- set the username and user email for git\n",
    "- list, create and delete files from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Git often comes pre-installed on Linux and MacOS.\n",
    "- If on Linux, we assume you know what you are doing.\n",
    "- If on the Mac, see the section below.\n",
    "- If on Windows, note that some of the specifics in the video might be a bit dated.\n",
    "  Basically, however, it is a matter of going to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and\n",
    "  following the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Following the instructions will involve the use of a shell / terminal. In case you\n",
    "  have never seen one before, first go through [Navigation in the windows shell](navigation-in-the-windows-shell)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MacOS specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have the\n",
    "[Xcode Command Line Tools](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/) installed, which\n",
    "already includes git. Check if these tools are already installed by running in the\n",
    "Terminal (see [Navigation in the unix shell](navigation-in-the-unix-shell) if you do\n",
    "not understand what we mean):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "xcode-select -p\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If they are not installed you will see `xcode-select: error: unable to get active developer directory...`.\n",
    "- You can check the output meaning [here](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/2).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can [install](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4) Xcode Tools with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "xcode-select --install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting the username and email is not optional!\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can skip the command line intro if you have seen the shell screencasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The video recommends some outdated programs. Stick to what we recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes git will open a code editor in which you can type a commit message or some\n",
    "other message. On most operating systems, the default editor for this is a command line\n",
    "editor like `vim` or `nano` that is hard to use. We recommend that you set it instead\n",
    "to vscode with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global core.editor \"code\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
