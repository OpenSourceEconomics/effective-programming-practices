    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this topic, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain why we use [pixi](https://prefix.dev/) to install Python\n",
    "- Follow the installation instructions at https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation\n",
    "- Execute python files from your shell using `pixi run`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-installation steps for macOS\n",
    "Verify you have the [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/) installed by running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "xcode-select -p\n",
    "```\n",
    "If they are not installed you will see `xcode-select: error: unable to get active developer directory...`.\n",
    "You can che what the output means [here](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/2).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can [install](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4) Xcode Tools with:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "xcode-select --install\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once you make sure you have XCode installed continue with the Pixi installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation for Windows, Linux & MacOS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow the installation instructions at https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation\n",
    "- Remember to start a new shell after installation!\n",
    "- In case you have any trouble, ask for help in the course Zulip\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting (Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there can be problems with the execution policies of Windows. You may get the\n",
    "following error when you try to activate a pixi shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "File C:\\Users\\xxx\\local\\Temp\\.xyz.ps1 cannot be loaded because\n",
    "the execution of scripts is disabled on this system. ...\n",
    "    * CategoryInfo          : SecurityError ...\n",
    "    * FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we will have to change the execution policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a Powershell via the Windows Start menu as administrator. To open it as administrator you need to right\n",
    "click on it and select \"Open as administrator\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now write\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finally, close the Powershell, open a new, regular one (i.e., without administrator\n",
    "   rights), and run `pixi shell` again.\n",
