    "# Installing git and some useful shell commands\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this topic, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- install git on your local machine\n",
    "- set the username and user email for git\n",
    "- list, create and delete files from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Git often comes pre-installed on Linux and MacOS. If on Linux, we assume you know what you are doing. If on the Mac, see the section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the specifics in the video might be a bit dated, but basically it\n",
    "is a matter of going to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and following the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MacOS specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have the [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/) installed, which already includes git.  \n",
    "Check if they are already installed by running in the Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "xcode-select -p\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If they are not installed you will see `xcode-select: error: unable to get active developer directory...`.\n",
    "- You can check the output meaning [here](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/2).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can [install](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4) Xcode Tools with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "xcode-select --install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Git is typically installed already on Linux and MacOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting the username and email is not optional!\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can skip the command line intro if you have seen the shell screencasts\n",
    "\n",
    "- The videos recommends some outdated programs. Stick to what we recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes git will open a code editor in which you can type a commit message or some\n",
    "other message. On most operating systems, the default editor for this is a command line\n",
    "editor like `vim` or `nano` that is hard to use. We recommend that you set it instead\n",
    "to vscode with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global core.editor \"code\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materials\n",
